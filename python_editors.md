# Tools for writing Python Code

## Python shell

The most basic interactive Python command line, where each line starts with a `>>>`.

## IDLE

Standard editor in Python distributions, easy to use but very basic.

## IPython

A more sophisticated interactive Python command line. It incorporates tab-completion, interactive help and regular shell commands. Also look up the `%`-magic commands.

## Spyder

**Spyder** is part of the **Anaconda** Python distribution. It is a small IDE mostly for data analysis, similar to RStudio. It automatically highlights Syntax errors, contains a variable explorer, debugging functionality and other useful things.

## Jupyter Notebooks

Interactive environment for the web browser. A Jupyter notebook contains Python code, text, images and any output from your program (including plots!). It is a great tool for exploratory data analysis.

## Sublime2

A general-purpose text editor that works on all systems. There are many plugins for Python available. There is a free and a commercial version available.

## Atom

The Open Source cousin of Sublime2. It is on my wishlist.

## PyCharm

PyCharm is probably the most luxurious IDE for Python. It contains tons of functions that are a superset of all the above. PyCharm is a great choice for bigger Python projects.

## Notepad++

If you must use a text editor on Windows to edit Python code, refuse to use anything worse than **Notepad++**.

## geany

I have no idea what **geany** even is, so I suppose it is a tool for MacOS.

## Vim

I know people who are successfully using Vim to write Python code and are happy with it.

## Emacs

I know people who are successfully using Emacs to write Python code, but haven't asked them how happy they are.
